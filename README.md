# Vulnerability Management Lab
A hands-on lab project focused on vulnerability management, demonstrating the installation of deprecated software, vulnerability scanning, and remediation techniques using Nessus and Windows updates. Includes practical examples and guidance for setting up a secure environment.

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and remediation through a practical lab setup using VMware and Nessus.

## Lab Setup
- **VM Configuration**: Installed VMware Workstation Player and configured a Windows 10 virtual machine.
  
## Initial Vulnerability Assessment
- Conducted an initial scan with Nessus, identifying vulnerabilities in the Windows OS and Microsoft Edge.

## Patch Management
- Analyzed remediation recommendations, focusing on the necessity of regular Windows updates for effective vulnerability resolution.

## Testing Outdated Software
- Installed a deprecated version of Firefox (36.0.12) to observe the impact of outdated applications on system security.

## Follow-Up Scanning
- Executed a second scan post-installation, noting an increase to 68 critical vulnerabilities.

## Remediation Actions
- Uninstalled the outdated Firefox version and performed comprehensive Windows updates to address remaining vulnerabilities.

## Final Assessment
- Conducted a final Nessus scan, confirming a significant reduction in critical and high vulnerabilities, while identifying further actions required for Microsoft Edge and native applications.

## Key Learnings
- Gained a thorough understanding of vulnerability management processes including scanning, remediation, automated patch management, and secure build standards.
