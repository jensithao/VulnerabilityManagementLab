# Vulnerability Management Lab

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and remediation through a practical lab setup using VMware and Nessus.

## Lab Setup
- **VM Configuration**: Installed VMware Workstation Player and configured a Windows 10 virtual machine.
